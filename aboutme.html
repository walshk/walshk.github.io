				<h3>Current Snapshot (from Summary)</h3>
				<p>I'm currently a senior at the University of Rochester, pursuing a degree in Business with a minor in Computer Science. I have experience in object-oriented programming, analytical scripting, and more, using languages and tools such as Java, Python, R, d3.js, HTML, CSS, Stata, and SQL. My professional interest lies primarily in the field of Data Science, with a connected interest in tech consulting for the Federal Government.</p>

				<h3>Professional History</h3>
				<p>At Pollinate Publicity, I improved on my general skill of working efficiently with data in Excel by assisting the student start-up’s initial break-even analysis. <br><br>In my second summer at the Town of Darien’s Department of Public Works, I took it upon myself to find actionable insights in the 15 years’ worth of sales data that was sitting untouched in the department’s Access database. I began moving the data over to spreadsheets in Excel, where I could perform basic analytics and build visualizations - leading the department to realize that they could favorably change the pricing scheme on recycling passes at the low cost of likely insignificant changes in demand. <br><br>As a Summer Games Intern for Booz Allen Hamilton and a member of the Soldier Performance and Readiness Science (SPARS) Team, I’ve taken charge of my team’s data-driven efforts to explore the relationship between physical stress and a soldier’s cognitive ability. This has involved drawing up possible data platform architectures and effectively communicating to the rest of the team how these technologies would operate. Additionally, I’ve written several scripts in Python to handle data ingestion, processing, and analytics, while using d3.js to build interactive data visualizations.</p>
