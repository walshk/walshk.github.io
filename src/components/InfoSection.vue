            I'm a full-stack developer with professional experience primarily in
            the field of web development, but throughout my career, I've worked
            with several different parts of the tech stack. In my current role,
            I act as both an engineer and also a product manager guiding
            priorities to ensure our team is producing a high-quality product.
            On this site, you can find descriptions of my work experience to
            date, technologies I have proficiency in, and some side projects
            I've worked on. Feel free to use the icons on the left to check out
            my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles or email me with any questions you
            might have.
