					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p>I'm currently a senior at the University of Rochester, pursuing a degree in Business with a minor in Computer Science. I have experience in object-oriented programming, analytical scripting, and more, using languages and tools such as Java, Python, R, d3.js, HTML, CSS, Stata, and SQL. My professional interest lies primarily in the field of Data Science, with a connected interest in tech consulting for the Federal Government.</p>

					<p>My technical coursework has provided me with not only basic knowledge of several programming tools, but also the ability to pick up new technical skills quickly and with relative ease. At the same time, my business coursework has helped me develop my skills in conveying ideas efficiently. These two channels combine to allow me to be an effective developer who can quickly transition into explaining the business aspects of a project.</p>

					<p>My complete resume can be found <a href="files/kwresume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

						<p>My first summer spent interning for the Town of Darien, CT's Department of Public Works. I was placed at the front desk, and given the responsibility of distributing access passes for the town Recycling Center to hundreds of residents every day.</p>

						<p class="timeline-content-date">Spring 2016</h2>
						<p>I was brought on as a Market Research &amp; Data Analysis Intern for Pollinate Publicity (a start-up at the University of Rochester) during the spring of my Sophomore year. My initial responsibility was to conduct interviews with students to research how they react to advertisements on campus. Once some data was gathered, I moved on to building projection tables in Excel to project revenues and expenses for a break-even analysis.</p>

						<p class="timeline-content-date">Summer 2016</h2>
						<p>I went back to the Department of Public Works for the summer after my sophomore year with a stronger creative drive. This time around, in addition to selling access passes, I aided in the development of a ten-year capital expenditures budget, found and analyzed fifteen years of sales data to learn about consumer habits, and authored a report on changes in consumer purchasing decisions after a past change in the department's pricing scheme.</p>

						<p>Back at the University of Rochester, I was hired as both a Workshop Leader for <i>CSC161 - Intro to Programming</i> and a Tutor for <i>ACC201 - Financial Accounting</i>. I stopped tutoring accounting after one semester due to low demand, but I've continued on as a Workshop Leader through the Fall 2017 semester (3 semesters). As a Workshop Leader, I'm responsible for conducting weekly 75-minute-long workshops in which I guide a class of 12 students through more advanced problems in the Python programming language.</p>

						<p class="timeline-content-date">Summer 2017</h2>
						<p>As a Summer Games Intern for Booz Allen Hamilton and a member of the Soldier Performance and Readiness Science (SPARS) Team, I took charge of my team’s data-driven efforts to explore the relationship between physical stress and a soldier’s cognitive ability. This involved drawing up possible data platform architectures and effectively communicating to the rest of the team how these technologies would operate. Additionally, I wrote several scripts in Python to handle data ingestion, processing, and analytics, while using d3.js to build interactive data visualizations (having no prior knowledge of D3 or JavaScript, I was able to pick up D3 within about a week and a half). I also put together a concept for a cloud-based data architecture using the firm's Open Data Platform, but had to leave it as a future step due to time constraints. After my experience during this summer, I was extended an offer to return to the firm and will be returning to Booz Allen after graduation as a Digital Solutions Developer.</p>
